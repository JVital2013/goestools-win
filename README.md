# Goestools for Windows
Goestools port for Windows. Originally by Pieter Noordhuis; ported to Windows by Jamie Vital. For goestools documentation, see the original docs [here](https://pietern.github.io/goestools/commands.html).

**Video Demo:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOpxVbBFl3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOpxVbBFl3Y)

## Running the programs
Once you have a dish, amplifier, and SDR set up, Download the lastest build from [releases](https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win/releases). Then, extract the zip and start goesrecv, followed by goesproc.

**NOTE:** if you are receiving GOES, download the release named goestools-win\*. The release named gk2a-goesrecv-win\* is a build of goesrecv for the GK-2A satellite only, and will not work with GOES satellites.

### System Requirements
- Windows Vista or newer
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. You probably have it already, but if not you can get it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
- An RTL-SDR or AirSpy SDR with driver installed
- Proper dish and amplifier for LRIT/HRIT reception

### Tools verified to work:
- goesrecv
- goesproc
- goeslrit
- lritdump
- areadump
- goespackets
- packetdump
- packetinfo
- benchmark
- compute_sync_words
- goesemwin - GOES-N EMWIN only. Built and verified operation for completeness.
- dcsdump - Old DCS lrit files only. New ones don't work on Linux either.
- unzip - Can extract zips with a single file in it, like the data section of NWS/EMWIN lrit image files. For debugging purposes.

## Troubleshooting
Having issues running Goestools for Windows? Here are some troubleshooting tips:
1. **Double-check that your Visual C++ Redistributable is up-to-date**
2. **If you're using a RTL-SDR**, make sure the correct driver is installed. Use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) and install the latest WinUSB driver.
3. **Make sure your antivirus did not delete or block any program files.**
    - There should be 35 files in your goestools `bin` folder - if there's less than that, look to see what's missing.
    - To verify the safety of all program files, run them through a reputable virus scanner like https://www.virustotal.com/.
4. **Verify that Windows Firewall has not blocked goestools:** When you run goesrecv for the first time, Windows Firewall should prompt you to allow access - make sure you select "yes". If you don't get the prompt, or if you close out of it, you may need to add a firewall exception manually.
5. **Still having issues?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win/discussions)!

## Compiling from source
For most users, I recommend using one of the pre-compiled releases. If you choose to compile from source: may the odds be ever in your favor.

### Configure Visual Studio
Install Visual Studio Community 2022 or greater. On install, set it up for "Desktop development with C++." Make sure "Git for Windows" gets installed as well.

### Configure vcpkg and build
Goestools for Windows comes with PowerShell scripts to set up vcpkg and build the software.

1. Open "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022" from the start Menu

2. Clone goestools-win somewhere on your computer via `git clone --recursive https://github.com/JVital2013/goestools-win`
3. Run Configure-VCPKG.ps1 in this repo to install and configure vcpkg.
4. If everything succeded, run Build.ps1 in this repo
5. Your compiled code will be in \<goestools-win\>\build\dist

## About Pull Requests
In an attempt to keep this goestools fork compatible with the official Goestools for Linux repo, I will only accept pull requests and bug reports for Windows-specific issues. If you want to add a feature, open a PR on the official branch, then let me know about it. I may merge PRs from the official repo as requested.

## Changes and Credits
Of course, a huge thanks to @pietern for the original goestools software. All I did was swap out parts to make it work on Windows, so all credit for this program should go to him.

This port was forked from goestools at 865e5c7. I made several (hundred?) code changes to facilitate compilation on Windows, but the core of the code has remained unchanged. The following additional patches have also been applied: 

- [Differentiate between DSI-CAPE and DSI-LI](https://github.com/pietern/goestools/pull/163) by @JVital2013
- [Fix getting admin text messages](https://github.com/pietern/goestools/pull/105) by @spinomaly
- [Added config option for EMWIN handler to disable output of TXT files](https://github.com/pietern/goestools/pull/79) by @tmbates12
- On the GK-2A build, I copied the sample rates for LRIT/HRIT from @sam210723's [fork of goestools](https://github.com/sam210723/goestools). My build is not the same as Sam's - there are additional changes he made that did not make it into the Windows build, but I do not believe they are necessary for successful use.

Additionally, thanks to @Aang23 for keeping his custom vcpkg public so I could see how to compile software like this.
